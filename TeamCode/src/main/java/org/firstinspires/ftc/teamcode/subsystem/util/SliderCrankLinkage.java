/**
 * <p>A slider-crank linkage is a type of linkage with one point of rotation which translates to
 * linear motion via a constrained slider. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider-crank_linkage">Wikipedia</a>
 * for more information. You can also see <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/skbfvczwpb">this interactive graph</a>
 * which calculates some useful information of the slider-crank linkage.</p>
 *
 * <p>In here, we call the axis the line where the linear motion is constrained. The base is the point on the axis that is
 * closest to the point of rotation of the crank. The slider is the point where the connecting rod connects to the axis.
 * We assume that the axis runs horizontally, with positive values going to the right. The crank is offset vertically, with
 * positive values going downwards. The angle of the crank is 0 when the crank is parallel to the axis and pointing to the
 * right. The angle increases as the crank rotates counterclockwise, using the above assumptions.</p>
